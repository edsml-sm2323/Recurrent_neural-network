# Recurrent_neural-network
Basic RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)ï¼ŒGated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

## Project 1: Use LSTM to predict gold prices (pytorch)
### Specific implementation:
Step 1: Conduct data analysis, find missing values, outliers, etc., and check the correlation between each data.
Step 2: Use pytorch to build a suitable GoldPriceDataset so that the Dataloader can output data suitable for LSTM.
Step 3: training and prediction.
